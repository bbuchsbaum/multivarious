\title{Compose Multiple Partial Projectors}
\usage{
compose_partial_projector(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A sequence of projectors that implement \code{partial_project()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{composed_partial_projector} object.
}
\description{
Creates a \code{composed_partial_projector} object that applies partial projections sequentially.
If multiple projectors are composed, the column indices (colind) used at each stage must be considered.
}
\examples{
# Suppose pca1 and pca2 support partial_project().
# cpartial <- compose_partial_projector(pca1, pca2)
# partial_project(cpartial, new_data, colind=1:5)
