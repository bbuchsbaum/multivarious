\title{Calculate Standardized Scores for SVD results}
\usage{
\method{std_scores}{svd}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{svd}, typically from \code{svd_wrapper}.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
A matrix of standardized scores (N x k) with columns having variance close to 1.
}
\description{
Computes standardized scores from an SVD result performed by \code{svd_wrapper}.
These scores are scaled to have approximately unit variance, assuming the original
data used for SVD was centered. They differ from the \code{s} component of the
\code{svd} object, which contains scores scaled by singular values.
