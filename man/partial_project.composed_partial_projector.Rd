\title{Partial Project Through a Composed Partial Projector}
\usage{
\method{partial_project}{composed_partial_projector}(x, new_data, colind, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{composed_partial_projector} object.}

\item{new_data}{The input data matrix or vector.}

\item{colind}{A numeric vector or a list of numeric vectors. If a single vector, applies to the first projector.
If a list, its length must match the number of projectors in \code{x}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{partial_project()} methods.}
}
\value{
The partially projected data after all projectors are applied.
}
\description{
Applies \code{partial_project()} through each projector in the composition.
If \code{colind} is a single vector, it applies to the first projector only. Subsequent projectors apply full columns.
If \code{colind} is a list, each element specifies the \code{colind} for the corresponding projector in the chain.
